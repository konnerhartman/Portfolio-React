# K. Hartman Portfolio (React)
  ![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)    

  ## Description
  This is my latest version of my portfolio using React. 
  My motivation to build this portfolio was to gain valuable experience using React.
  Aside from gaining experience, I built this app to showcase my abilities with the technologies that were used (NodeJS, NPM, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React, Bootstrap).
  While working on this project, I stuggled a bit with the layout, where everything belonged, and how it all connected and worked together with the React app.
  The issues presented above allowed me the opportunity to dive into documentation and find resolutions. I essentially learned how to use React while building this portfolio.
